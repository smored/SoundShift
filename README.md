# SoundShift

## Preface
In an age where digital streaming platforms have revolutionized how we listen to music, many platforms have expanded their offerings to include QoL features and new ways to enjoy music for casual listeners and audiophiles alike. However, there remains an untapped potential. SoundShift aims to address this gap by catering to audiophiles seeking maximum customization while remaining accessible to all. Originally, we planned to utilize an open-source media player library, but we've now shifted our focus to a local library. This local library allows us to develop a solution tailored to our requirements. Nonetheless, our plan remains the same for implementing all requirements outlined in the original proposal. SoundShift will deliver basic music playback, playlist management, robust error handling, and customizable user settings, promising an immersive music experience.

## Introduction
Enter SoundShift. This software gives users the full ability to customize and tinker with their listening experience that other streaming services gloss over or hide from the user to make their UI simpler. The end goal is to be able to set up several playlists and “link” them together to create a smoother listening experience and prevent jarring transitions between songs, while still being able to shuffle your songs for a new listening experience each time. It does this by randomly selecting a new song to play based on weightings that are user-defined and by searching for which songs are linked to the one currently playing.
